# Chromatic Icons for Vivaldi
Not everyone likes the somewhat retro style of the classic vivaldi icon. This is why I created an alternative, complete with a template that can be used to create your own Vivaldi icon to fit your OS/browser theme.

## How do I apply them?
I believe that these icons can be used on any OS as long as you adapt them to the right format. Don't ask me about anything else that Windows, however, because this is what I designed them for. If you want to create a new ico file with another color, I recommend to save it as png and then use [this website](https://icoconvert.com/) to convert it to ico as it will scale properly on Windows.

Before changing the icon on your desktop, the new icon needs to be stored properly first, because it will stop working if you move it afterwards. *If you're using cloud storage, make sure it's not on a virtual drive, because it need to be available the moment you log in to not appear as blank.*

There are 3 basic scenarios:
1. Shortcuts: This is the easiest scenario since you only need to right-click, go into properties and click "Change icon".
2. Taskbar: It only works if it's pinned. You can find the shortcut in `%appdata%\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\TaskBar`. *Follow scenario 1.* You then have to restart explorer.exe, disconnect or reboot for the new icon to show up.
3. Start menu: The shortcuts are located in `%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs`. However, the default icon will reset everytime Vivaldi is updated. The easiest solution is to create a copy of the shortcut under a different name. *Follow scenario 1 on the new shortcut.* If you're a bit more savvy, instead of making a copy, you can change the permissions of the original shortcut so that Vivaldi cannot update it anymore (be careful with that).
